# Deep-Q MarI/O
This is a fork of Google's Deep Q Network code used to master classic Atari games. This has been adapted here to play Super Mario Bros. It uses a double deep Q network to control an open-source Nintendo Entertainment System emulator called FCEUX.

For instructions and a summary of changes to the original Google project, please see [this blog post.](http://www.ehrenbrav.com/2016/08/teaching-your-computer-to-play-super-mario-bros-a-fork-of-the-google-deepmind-atari-machine-learning-project/)
